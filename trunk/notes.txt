Video backgrounds (avi, mov, mp4, mod, mpg, mpeg, wmv, mp2)
	I'm thinking use FFMPEG to convert the selected media to the simplest format.
	Then use Java to read the image data from that format.
	FFMPEG is GPL or LGPL. We would most likely need the GPL. I think it can be distributed with my app.
	
	Currently the TranstionDisplayPanel and associated transtions will not work with video backgrounds.
	When/if we get around to this, we may need to re-engineer the display sub system.
