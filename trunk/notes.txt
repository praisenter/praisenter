Nursery overlay

2nd language bible under english

Video backgrounds (avi, mov, mp4, mod, mpg, mpeg, wmv, mp2)
	I'm thinking use FFMPEG to convert the selected media to the simplest format.
	Then use Java to read the image data from that format.
	FFMPEG is GPL or LGPL. We would most likely need the GPL. I think it can be distributed with my app.

Song queues

Multiple consecutive verses can be placed on one screen
	I rarely use this because most of the time the verses are too long.
	
Provide a lyrics look up functionality
	No acceptable services available at this time for christian lyrics.

database lookups
	we could add a next/prev id to each verse after they have all been added
	add debugging log statemtents to track time usage on lookups vs. rendering (profile)

INSTALL
I think install can be done by the application jar (for now)
	- we need to package a .zip of a fresh db
	- we need to package dependent .jar files
	- we need to create local folders (config, database, lib, licenses, etc)
