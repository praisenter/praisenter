Dependency Notes
===============================================================================
Oracle Java 1.7 (other Java implementations may have different requirements)
	o http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/config-417990.html
	o Windows XP SP3 or higher (32 or 64 bit)
	o Ubuntu 11.04 or higher (32 or 64 bit)
	o Mac OS X 10.7.3 or higher (64 bit only) Java 1.7.10+ needed

Xuggler 5.4 Supported Platforms
	o http://www.xuggle.com/downloads
	o Java 1.5+
	o Windows XP or higher (32 or 64 bit)
	o Ubuntu 11.10 or later (32 or 64 bit)
	o Mac OS X 10.7 or higher (32 or 64 bit)

===============================================================================
Version 2.0.0
===============================================================================
Platforms:
  o Windows:
  	- Vista or higher (32 or 64 bit); It may work on XP SP3 or higher but has 
  	  not been tested.
  o Mac:
	- OS X 10.7.3 or higher (64 bit only); 10.7.3 is the earliest Oracle Java 
	  1.7 supported OS
	- OS X starting with Mountain Lion will begin phasing out the Apple 
	  developed Java runtime. As a result, Java 1.7 is not available by 
	  default. To get Java 1.7 go to the Oracle dowload page 
	  (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) and
	  download and install the Java 1.7 **JDK** for Mac OS. Installing the
	  JRE does not update the path environment variables.
	- OS X users must use the JNLP rather than the .zip distributable due to
	  new OS X application security requirements that block the execution
	  of untrusted applications.
	- OS X will automatically unzip any downloaded zip files. This is a 
	  problem for Praisenter as it expects to import bibles and slides using 
	  the zip format. To fix this, re-compress the unzipped files before
	  import.
  o Linux ***Right now Ubuntu is broken. See Open Issues below.***
	- Ubuntu 11.10 or higher (32 or 64 bit); It may work on other Linux 
	  distributions but has not been tested
	- Java 1.7 for Ubuntu by default uses the OpenJDK which is nearly identical
	  to the Oracle version except that Java Webstart is not included. To run 
	  Praisenter, you will need to download IcedTea from the Ubuntu Software 
	  Center. Alternatively you can download and install the Oracle JVM from 
	  http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html.
  o Java 1.7 or higher.
  o 512 MB of dedicated RAM (1 GB would be best for video)
  
New Features: 
  o Video & Audio media support (still experimental) for backgrounds and
    standalone components
  o Media Library for managing images, video, and audio.
  o Custom standalone slides
  o Slide templates for notification, bible, and songs.
  o Template switching
  o Slide/Template editor
  o Slide/Template Library for managing templates and slides.
  o Slide/Template resolution targeting
  o Slide/Template import and export
  o Slide and component borders
  o Gradient support.
  o Preferences manager
  o More informative Error Reporting buttons (save vs. send)
  o A new easing "Back"
  o Transition waiting
  o Render quality settings
  o Text outline
  o Application working path moved to user/home directory
  
Bug Fixes:
  o Auto adjusting of slides and templates based on target resolution and
    actual resolution
  o Reworked some transitions that were not pixel perfect
  
Other:
  o Package separation. Not really useful to users but to developers this is
  	key. The packages have been cleaned up to allow use of certain packages
  	rather than the entire code base.
  o New deployment license:
  	The majority of Praisenter source code is released under the New BSD open 
  	source license.  The video and audio support now requires the GPL v3 on 
  	related sources (ones that directly interact with the GPL v3 libraries).
  	The distribution binaries are required to be GPL v3 now.

Open Issues:
  o Ubuntu, the test Linux system, Per-pixel translucency is broken. This is a
    Java problem and is still not fixed as of 1.7.0_13. This makes Praisenter
    unusable on Ubuntu. It still may work on other Linux distributions.

  o Video looping. As of this release the video and audio support is mostly 
    experimental, working with most of the audio/video on hand. However, a few
    videos have been know to fail to loop correctly.

  o OGG video synchronization. As of this release the OGG audio/video 
    synchronization of videos is not working correctly. Depending on the video,
    you may have different results.
    https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/xuggler-users/CIti0aIsUlc
  o Video jumping and overall video smoothness. This is typically caused by 
    slower machines. The test hardware used is more than able to handle video 
    playback. However, rendering the playing video in the same process causes 
    some problems. When scrolling the song preview, the playing video may 
    jitter and jump. This is due to Swing EDT locking on GUI tasks. Many 
    attempts have been made to fix this with varying degrees of success:
    	- Using another EDT by using Sun specific AppContext class. This does
    	  not solve the problem because there is some underlying locking 
    	  mechanism for Java2D rendering. This is also not desired since it 
    	  would require the Oracle/OpenJDK JVMs and is not public API.
    	- Using another Java process and communicated via Java RMI. This works
    	  great minus one large hitch. When sending a new slide, Praisenter 
    	  (the main process) cannot make the sub process the focused 
    	  application and therefore cannot bring the slide to the front.
    	- Use active rendering for the presentation window. This doesn't work
    	  with window translucency (which is a requirement for transitions) in
    	  Java.
    	  https://forums.oracle.com/forums/thread.jspa?threadID=2468664
    	- JOGL's NEWT windowing system has a separate EDT and use OpenGL. This
    	  was too slow when rendering the composite in Java2D and sending it 
    	  down to JOGL. Some more exploration is required on this one.
    	- JavaFX has its own EDT as well. More exploration is required on this
    	  one.
  o The Xuggler API which is being used for audio/video playback and reading
    is no longer receiving updates and the build server has been shutdown.
    Short term this isn't a big deal, but long term this could be a problem
    especially if any bugs arise. As of this release there is no alternative
    which is easy to use, allows composition, and is packaged easy.
