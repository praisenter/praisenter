Version 2.0.1
===============================================================================
Platforms:
  o Tested on Windows XP SP3
  o Same as 2.0.0 other than the above.
  
New Features: 
  o Copy verse text. Right click (or command click) the verse queue or bible
    search to get the copy context menu.
  o More system properties have been added to the System menu to aid in 
    troubleshooting problems.
  o Added a preference to do video color/size conversion at read time rather
    than at play time. This can boost performance in some cases.
  o Added video preview to the Add Media dialog.
  o Added a Blank button for song display which allows a blank slide using
    the current template to be sent.
  o Added sorting to all tabular data (searches, queues, etc.)
  o Add multiple verses from the Bible search to the verse queue at one time.
  
Bug Fixes:
  o Fixed the dialog title on the Slide Library (says Media Library on 2.0.0)
  o Fixed a bug on Linux which made translucent slides/templates not clear
    their previous rendering. (this is one step towards fully supporting
    linux, but did reveal another problem: flickering) The previous problem
    of per-pixel translucency was caused by Ubuntu running under Oracle
    Virtual box.  Installing Ubuntu along side Windows and booting to Ubuntu
    revealed that this is not an issue.
  o Fixed a bug with WMV video playback where the video playback would pause
    after a second or two due to a large video frame rate and a low audio
    frame rate.
  o Fixed a bug where the XugglerMediaPlayer was not cleaning up all its
    resources (threads in this case).
  o Small bug fix for dual translation display when one translation does
    not have the current, next, or previous verse.
  o Increased the scroll rate of the song slide preview when scrolling with
    the mouse scroll wheel.
  o When performing searches (bible and song), the scrollbar would stay
    positioned. It now resets to the top on each search.
  
Other:
  o When adding media, the media type defaults to All Files instead of
    image media.
  o Default song template now matches the default bible template.
  o Changed the Current/Previous/Next verse labels to the verse location and
    increased the font size and bolded the current verse.
  o Small GUI label/tooltip changes.

Open Issues:
  o On Ubuntu Linux we get flickering in the animations due to the use of
    translucent windows.
  o Same as 2.0.0 except for the above

===============================================================================
Version 2.0.0
===============================================================================
Platforms:
  o Windows:
  	- Vista or higher (32 or 64 bit); It may work on XP SP3 or higher but has 
  	  not been tested.
  o Mac:
	- Mac OS X (64 bit) 10.7.3 or higher is required for Java 1.7.
	- Mac OS X has discontinued their implementation of Java (which stopped at
	  Java 1.6) and is no longer distributing it with their operating systems.  
	  See what this means for you: 
	  http://www.java.com/en/download/faq/java_mac.xml 
	  http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/webnotes/install/mac/mac-install-faq.html#revert2012-006.
	  Be sure to read these before installing Oracle Java.
	- Mac OS X users will need to download the Oracle JDK rather than the JRE 
	  to make sure it updates the path environment variable.
	- Mac OS X Mountain Lion has a new security model (Gatekeeper) for 
	  untrusted applications.  Because of this you will need to use the 
	  Webstart download of Praisenter rather than the .zip download.  You can 
	  use the .zip download by changing some settings, but this is not 
	  recommended; read why here: 
	  http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/jweb/mac-faq.html#gatekeeper.
	- Mac OS X automatically decompresses archives after downloading.  This is 
	  a problem since Praisenter uses the compressed format to import new 
	  bibles and exported slides/templates.  To remedy this, re-compress the 
	  uncompressed files.
  o Linux
	- As of the latest release of Praisenter, a critical feature of Java 1.7 
	  is broken on Ubuntu, making Praisenter useless on this platform.  Other
	  Linux distributions may work.
	- Ubuntu 11.10 or higher 32 or 64 bit.  Other Linux distributions may 
	  work as well but has not been tested.
	- Be sure your system software is up to date.
	- Linux users will typically have Java 6 installed (typically OpenJDK 
	  which is basically the same as Oracle’s Java).  Open the Ubuntu 
	  Software Center to check which version of Java you have installed (type 
	  in Java in the search box).  Alternatively you can download and install
	  Oracle Java 7.  This allows you to skip the next step, but may still 
	  require the final step.
	- You may also need to install the latest IcedTea Webstart (install from 
	  the same place as Java 7) if you want to use the Java Webstart download.
	  Alternatively you can use the .zip download.
	- Linux users may get a error if Java 7 was installed along side Java 6.  
	  Run the following command lines and select the Java 7 option by choosing 
	  the correct number (this tells Ubuntu which Java to use by default):
	  => sudo update-alternatives --config java
	  => sudo update-alternatives --config javaws
  o Java 1.7 or higher.
  o 512 MB of dedicated RAM (1 GB would be best for video)
  
New Features: 
  o Video & Audio media support (still experimental) for backgrounds and
    standalone components
  o Media Library for managing images, video, and audio.
  o Custom standalone slides
  o Slide templates for notification, bible, and songs.
  o Template switching
  o Slide/Template editor
  o Slide/Template Library for managing templates and slides.
  o Slide/Template resolution targeting
  o Slide/Template import and export
  o Slide and component borders
  o Gradient support.
  o Preferences manager
  o More informative Error Reporting buttons (save vs. send)
  o A new easing "Back"
  o Transition waiting
  o Render quality settings
  o Text outline
  o Application working path moved to user/home directory
  
Bug Fixes:
  o Auto adjusting of slides and templates based on target resolution and
    actual resolution
  o Reworked some transitions that were not pixel perfect
  
Other:
  o Package separation. Not really useful to users but to developers this is
  	key. The packages have been cleaned up to allow use of certain packages
  	rather than the entire code base.
  o New deployment license:
  	The majority of Praisenter source code is released under the New BSD open 
  	source license.  The video and audio support now requires the GPL v3 on 
  	related sources (ones that directly interact with the GPL v3 libraries).
  	The distribution binaries are required to be GPL v3 now.

Open Issues:
  o Ubuntu, the test Linux system, Per-pixel translucency is broken. This is a
    Java problem and is still not fixed as of 1.7.0_13. This makes Praisenter
    unusable on Ubuntu. It still may work on other Linux distributions.
    http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=9000011
  o Video looping. As of this release the video and audio support is mostly 
    experimental, working with most of the audio/video on hand. However, a few
    videos have been know to fail to loop correctly.
    https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/xuggler-users/bMQEJdQY2WU
  o OGG video synchronization. As of this release the OGG audio/video 
    synchronization of videos is not working correctly. Depending on the video,
    you may have different results.
    https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/xuggler-users/CIti0aIsUlc
  o Video jumping and overall video smoothness. This is typically caused by 
    slower machines. The test hardware used is more than able to handle video 
    playback. However, rendering the playing video in the same process causes 
    some problems. When scrolling the song preview, the playing video may 
    jitter and jump. This is due to Swing EDT locking on GUI tasks. Many 
    attempts have been made to fix this with varying degrees of success:
    	- Using another EDT by using Sun specific AppContext class. This does
    	  not solve the problem because there is some underlying locking 
    	  mechanism for Java2D rendering. This is also not desired since it 
    	  would require the Oracle/OpenJDK JVMs and is not public API.
    	- Using another Java process and communicated via Java RMI. This works
    	  great minus one large hitch. When sending a new slide, Praisenter 
    	  (the main process) cannot make the sub process the focused 
    	  application and therefore cannot bring the slide to the front.
    	- Use active rendering for the presentation window. This doesn't work
    	  with window translucency (which is a requirement for transitions) in
    	  Java.
    	  https://forums.oracle.com/forums/thread.jspa?threadID=2468664
    	- JOGL's NEWT windowing system has a separate EDT and use OpenGL. This
    	  was too slow when rendering the composite in Java2D and sending it 
    	  down to JOGL. Some more exploration is required on this one.
    	- JavaFX has its own EDT as well. More exploration is required on this
    	  one.
  o The Xuggler API which is being used for audio/video playback and reading
    is no longer receiving updates and the build server has been shutdown.
    Short term this isn't a big deal, but long term this could be a problem
    especially if any bugs arise. As of this release there is no alternative
    which is easy to use, allows composition, and is packaged easy.
