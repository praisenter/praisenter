  <description>
    Praisenter is a user-friendly presentation management tool designed to 
    streamline the creation and delivery of presentations tailored to churches. 
    With a focus on simplicity and functionality, Praisenter allows users to 
    create slides and templates with embedded images and videos with full 
    control of the content position, font size, colors, and more.  Templates 
    can be used to show Bible verses and song lyrics from the library.  Bibles 
    and song lyrics can be imported from a few source formats, but can also be 
    created from within the app.  Templates also support showing up to two 
    languages at the same time.  Praisenter supports presenting content on any 
    connected device whether it be a TV, projector, or monitor, limited only to 
    the number of connected devices.
