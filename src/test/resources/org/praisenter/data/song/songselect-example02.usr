Words=Every blessing You pour out/nI'll turn back to praise/nWhen the darkness closes in/nLord still I will say/nBlessed be the name of the Lord/nBlessed be Your name/nBlessed be the name of the Lord/nBlessed be Your glorious name/tBlessed be Your name/nIn the land that is plentiful/nWhere Your streams of abundance flow/nBlessed be Your name/tBlessed be Your name/nWhen I'm found in the desert place/nThough I walk through the wilderness/nBlessed be Your name/tBlessed be Your name/nWhen the sun's shining down on me/nWhen the world's all as it should be/nBlessed be Your name/tBlessed be Your name/nOn the road marked with suffering/nThough there's pain in the offering/nBlessed be Your name/t(BRIDGE)/nYou give and take away/nYou give and take away/nMy heart will choose to say/nLord blessed be Your name
