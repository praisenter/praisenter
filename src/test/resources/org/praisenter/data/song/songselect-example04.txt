You Are My King


Chorus 1
Amazing love
How can it be
That You my King
Would die for me
Amazing love
I know it's true
It's my joy to honor You
In all I do I honor You

			
Verse 1
I'm forgiven
Because You were forsaken
I'm accepted
You were condemned
I'm alive and well
Your Spirit is within me
Because You died
And rose again

			
Misc 1
(ENDING)
You are my King
You are my King
Jesus You are my King
Jesus You are my King
