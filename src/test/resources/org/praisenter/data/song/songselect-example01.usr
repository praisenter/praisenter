Words=Amazing grace how sweet the sound/nThat saved a wretch like me/nI once was lost but now am found/nWas blind but now I see/t'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear/nAnd grace my fears relieved/nHow precious did that grace appear/nThe hour I first believed/tThe Lord has promised good to me/nHis Word my hope secures/nHe will my shield and portion be/nAs long as life endures/tThrough many dangers toils and snares/nI have already come/n'Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far/nAnd grace will lead me home/tYea when this flesh and heart shall fail/nAnd mortal life shall cease/nI shall possess within the veil/nA life of joy and peace/tWhen we've been there ten thousand years/nBright shining as the sun/nWe've no less days to sing God's praise/nThan when we first begun
