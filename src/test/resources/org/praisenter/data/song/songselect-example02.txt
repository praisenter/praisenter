Blessed Be Your Name


Chorus 1
Every blessing You pour out
I'll turn back to praise
When the darkness closes in
Lord still I will say
Blessed be the name of the Lord
Blessed be Your name
Blessed be the name of the Lord
Blessed be Your glorious name

			
Verse 1
Blessed be Your name
In the land that is plentiful
Where Your streams of abundance flow
Blessed be Your name

			
Verse 2
Blessed be Your name
When I'm found in the desert place
Though I walk through the wilderness
Blessed be Your name

			
Verse 3
Blessed be Your name
When the sun's shining down on me
When the world's all as it should be
Blessed be Your name

			
Verse 4
Blessed be Your name
On the road marked with suffering
Though there's pain in the offering
Blessed be Your name

			
Misc 1
(BRIDGE)
You give and take away
You give and take away
My heart will choose to say
Lord blessed be Your name
