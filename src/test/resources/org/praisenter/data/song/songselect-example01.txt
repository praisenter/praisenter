Amazing Grace


Verse 1
Amazing grace how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now am found
Was blind but now I see

			
Verse 2
'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed

			
Verse 3
The Lord has promised good to me
His Word my hope secures
He will my shield and portion be
As long as life endures

			
Verse 4
Through many dangers toils and snares
I have already come
'Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far
And grace will lead me home

			
Verse 5
Yea when this flesh and heart shall fail
And mortal life shall cease
I shall possess within the veil
A life of joy and peace

			
Verse 6
When we've been there ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we first begun
